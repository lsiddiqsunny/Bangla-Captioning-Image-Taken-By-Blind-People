# Bangla-Captioning-Image-Taken-By-Blind-People

Blind people are important part of our society. Due to technological revelation, it is easy enough to use
smart phone and capturing image by voice or semi/fully guided command. It will be helpful to caption
the captured image and describe the image to the blind people. Our target is solving this problem with
computer vision, machine learning and image processing.

The idea originates from Gurari er al who are responsible for creating a dataset with 39,000 images
originating from people who are blind that are each paired with five English captions. We are going to
build a similar dataset for Bangla language. For creating the dataset, we are considering two ways. One is
using crowd workers and another is using translator API. At first, we are going to use translator API to
build the pipeline for predicting captions from the images captured by blind people. In parallel, our
crowd workers will caption the image in Bangla language. After building the dataset, we are likely to
build our pipeline with pretrained models for captioning the image.

Currently, we are building our dataset pipeline. We are hoping to complete and generating a result
within November, 2020.
